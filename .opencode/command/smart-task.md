# Smart Task with Continual Learning

You are executing a task with the Continual Learning workflow enabled. This ensures you learn from each task and improve future performance.

## 📖 Phase 1: Context Loading (MANDATORY - DO THIS FIRST)

Before generating any code or making any changes, you MUST:

1. **Read the lessons file**: Use the `read` tool to read `.opencode/memory/lessons_learned.md`
2. **Analyze the lessons**: Look for:
   - Related Do's that should guide your approach
   - Related Don'ts that you must avoid
   - Edge Cases relevant to the task
   - Project-specific patterns to follow
3. **Acknowledge the learning**: Briefly summarize what lessons are relevant to this task

⚠️ **DO NOT proceed to execution until you have read and acknowledged the lessons.**

---

## ⚙️ Phase 2: Task Execution

Execute the user's requested task, keeping the lessons in mind:

1. Apply relevant Do's and patterns
2. Avoid documented Don'ts and anti-patterns
3. Consider documented Edge Cases
4. Follow Project-Specific Patterns

If you discover a new pattern, insight, or make a mistake during execution, take note of it for the reflection phase.

---

## 🤔 Phase 3: Retrospective & Reflection (MANDATORY)

After completing the task, you MUST reflect on the experience:

1. **Was the task successful?**
   - Did everything work as expected?
   - Were there any issues or errors?

2. **Did you learn anything new?**
   - Did you discover a new pattern or approach?
   - Did you encounter an edge case not documented?

3. **Did the lessons help?**
   - Did the knowledge base help you avoid a mistake?
   - Were any lessons particularly relevant?

4. **What should be documented?**
   - Any new patterns discovered?
   - Any mistakes made that others should avoid?
   - Any edge cases encountered?

---

## 📝 Phase 4: Update Knowledge Base (If Applicable)

If ANY of the following occurred, you MUST update `.opencode/memory/lessons_learned.md`:

### When to Update:
- ✅ You discovered a new best practice (Add to "Do's")
- ✅ You made a mistake that should be avoided (Add to "Don'ts")
- ✅ You encountered a tricky edge case (Add to "Edge Cases & Gotchas")
- ✅ You learned about a project-specific pattern (Add to "Project-Specific Patterns")

### Format for New Entries:
Add entries under the appropriate section using this format:

```
### [Date]

**Issue**: [Brief description of what happened or was learned]

**Lesson**: [Concise explanation of what to do or avoid]

**Example**: [Optional - short code snippet or example]

**Impact**: [Optional - why this matters]
```

### How to Update:
1. Read the current `lessons_learned.md` file
2. Append your new entry to the appropriate section
3. Update the "Last Updated" date at the top
4. Use the `write` tool to save the updated file

---

## 📊 Phase 5: Activity Capture (Living Documentation)

After updating the knowledge base, you MUST capture development activity for living documentation:

### Step 1: Read Current Session Transcript

Use `session_read` to retrieve the completed session transcript:
```
session_read(session_id="<current_session_id>", include_transcript=true)
```

### Step 2: Scan for Activity Patterns

Analyze the transcript for these patterns:

**TODOs and Deferred Items:**
- `TODO:`
- `FIXME:`
- `XXX:`
- `HACK:`
- `NOTE:`

**Debug Statements:**
- `console.log(`
- `console.debug(`
- `console.warn(`
- `debugger`
- `// DEBUG`
- `/* DEBUG */`

**Errors and Exceptions:**
- `Error:`
- `throw new Error`
- `catch (error)`
- `exception`
- `failed`
- `Failed to`

### Step 3: Extract Context

For each pattern found, capture:
- **Date**: Current session date
- **Category/Tag**: Auto-detect based on file path (e.g., `#auth` from `src/auth/`)
- **Location**: File path and line number
- **Context**: Brief description or surrounding code
- **Severity**: High (errors), Medium (TODOs), Low (debug notes)

### Step 4: Update Activity Log

Read `.opencode/memory/activity_log.md` and append captured entries to appropriate sections:

**Active TODOs section:**
```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD
- **[TAG]** Description → `file/path.ext:line`
```

**Debug Notes section:**
```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD
- `file/path.ext:line` → pattern found
```

**Errors Observed section:**
```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD
- **[TAG]** Error description → `file/path.ext:line`
  - Error details
  - Root cause (if known)
  - Status: Pending investigation
```

**Activity Summary section:**
```markdown
### Session: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
- Duration: [calculated from session]
- Tasks: [user's task description]
- Files modified: [count]
- TODOs created: [count]
- Debug statements: [count]
- Errors encountered: [count]
```

### Step 5: Update Tags Index

Update the Tags Index section to reflect new entries:
```markdown
### #tag
- Active TODOs: [count]
- Debug notes: [count]
- Errors: [count]
```

### Step 6: Auto-Promote Recurring Patterns (Optional)

If the user passed `--auto-promote` flag or configuration enables it:

1. **Check for recurring errors** (3+ occurrences in activity log)
2. **Check for recurring TODOs** (unresolved for >14 days)
3. **Promote to lessons_learned.md** if criteria met:
   - Add to "Don'ts" section for error patterns
   - Add to "Do's" section for successful patterns
   - Add to "Edge Cases" for recurring gotchas

### Step 7: Save Activity Log

Use `write` tool to save the updated `.opencode/memory/activity_log.md`

### When to Skip Activity Capture

You MAY skip this phase if:
- ✅ Task was trivial (<5 minutes, single file change)
- ✅ User explicitly requested with `--no-activity` flag
- ✅ No activity patterns found in session

**Otherwise**: Always complete Phase 5 to maintain living documentation.

## 🎯 The Goal

Continual Learning with Living Documentation means:
- Every task makes you smarter
- Every mistake becomes a lesson
- Every success becomes a pattern
- Every TODO gets tracked
- Every debug statement gets noted
- Future tasks benefit from past experience
- Development activity is transparent and searchable

**Remember**: This is a loop. Each task improves the knowledge base and activity log, which in turn improves future task execution.

*Knowledge is cumulative. Keep learning!*
